            <p>Some notiable academic contributions from Andrew Riley Zodrow include the creation of the <a href=../../extras/zodrowtheorem.html>Zodrow Theorem</a> as well as the challenging moral dilemma that shocked the world known as the <a href="../../extras/zodrowdilemma.html">Zodrow Dilemma</a>. Drew is also well know for using his presonality to manipulate and annoy teachers into granting him positive grades for his academics. Zodrow can be attributed to the <a href="../../extras/youngpoison.html">Poisoning of Mr. John Younge</a> through the use of toxic banana spray, a decline in Mr. Jason Felt's mental health, as well as being a member of Fred Friedman's class.</p>
