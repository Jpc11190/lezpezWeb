      <p>Chapter 1: Shadows of Deception<br><br>

        The moon shone brightly in the cloudless sky, casting an eerie glow over the deserted town. Jaiden the Raider, a seasoned outlaw with a reputation for audacious heists, had set his sights on a prize that would elevate his notoriety to legendary status—the prized stallion of Joshua Patterson, a wealthy white rancher known for breeding the finest horses in the land.
        
        Under the cover of darkness, Jaiden slithered through the narrow blocks like a shadow. Dressed in black man caricature from head to toe, he blended seamlessly with the night, his every movement calculated and precise. With unparalleled stealth, he reached Patterson's sprawling ranch, its sturdy wooden fences looming before him.<br><br>
        
        Chapter 2: Stealthy Maneuvers<br><br>

        Jaiden studied the ranch from afar, alread knowing abit about Joshua's ranch from sleeping with him, making passionate love the night before. Jaiden was assessing every potential obstacle and guard post. He knew the task ahead wouldn't be easy. Patterson had employed a small army of watchful ranch hands to protect his valuable possessions. But Jaiden was a master of deception, using every trick in the book to get what he wanted.<br>
        
        Silently, he scaled the fence, his nimble fingers gripping the wooden beams effortlessly. Dropping into the courtyard, he stayed close to the shadows, evading the few patrolling guards. The moon illuminated the corral where Patterson's prized stallion, Gina, stood majestically, its jet-black coat shimmering in the pale light.<br><br>
        
        Chapter 3: The Perfect Ride<br><br>
        
        With bated breath, Jaiden approached Gina, his heart racing in anticipation. The horse, sensing a visitor, snorted and tossed its head, its fiery eyes filled with an untamed spirit. Jaiden's plan relied on his ability to tame Gina and ride him to freedom—an unprecedented feat that would add another layer to his already legendary status.<br>
        
        Gently, Jaiden extended his hand, speaking to the horse in soothing tones, and attempted to seduce it with his charisma. Gina, though wary, seemed to sense Jaiden's intentions, and gradually, the tension between man and beast dissipated. With practiced precision, Jaiden saddled the magnificent creature, marveling at its raw power.<br><br>
        
        Chapter 4: The Escape<br><br>
        
        Just as Jaiden was about to mount Gina, the piercing sound of an alarm broke the silence. He cursed under his breath, knowing he had precious little time to escape before Joshua descended upon him like a toxic hound. With one swift movement, he swung himself onto Gina's back, urging the horse into a full gallop.<br>
        
        As the pair thundered through the ranch, Jaiden expertly dodged the Joshua who pursued them, his adrenaline surging through his veins. Gina surged forward, displaying a strength and speed that left Jaiden in awe. Together, they soared over fences and darted through narrow paths, leaving the ranch and its bewildered guards in their dust.<br><br>
        
        Chapter 5: The Pursuit<br><br>
        
        The chase continued through the treacherous terrain, with Jaiden and Gina maintaining a slim lead over their relentless pursuers. Joshua, fueled by rage of being betrayed by his former lover, pushed his horse to the limit.<br>
        
        However, Jaiden's intimate knowledge of the surrounding area worked in his favor. He steered Gina through winding canyons, traversed rugged hillsides, and even leapt over a roaring river, always staying one step ahead of his pursuers.<br>

        Then, a way out, a train in the distance was close to crossing his path. Without a rein, he slapped the ass of Gina to push the horse to their absolute limit. Joshua was coming closer, with desperation as he realized that Jaiden might get away with his beloved horse. With the train closing in, and Gina slowing down, Jaiden realized that he wasn't going to make it with the horse. As a last ditch effort, Jaiden ejected from the horse, mere meters from crossing the track. The horse kept going, and was then hit by the train. A mighty roar came from the horse as it was brutally maimed by the force of the train. The horse being ripped in half, with their organs spilling out on the groud. Gina was dead ...<br><br>
        
        Chapter 6: Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night<br><br>
        
        Jaiden fleed the scene before looking back to see the horrific sight. Joshua rushed to the scene to say his last goodbyes to the horse. He attempted to comfort the horse whilst uncontrollably sobbing and kissing the horse to lessen the pain of being ripped in half. With Jaiden seeing the scene, he realized something, something off about the relationship between the horse and Joshua. Gina was more than just a Horse to Joshua, he was a lover to Joshua who would make passionate love with him in the ranch. Jaiden realized this when Joshua attempted to give Gina one last gift<br><br>
        Whilst Joshua was giving love to the horse, he started to scream, and roar in pain. The last thing he saw of the thief was a black figure. Joshua screamed racist, anti black slurs whilst crying and unloading into the horse. Jaiden, being horrified by the scene, disappeared into the night.<br><br>
