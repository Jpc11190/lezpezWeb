      <h2>Introduction and History</h2><br>
      <p>
        The Debaucherous Archives is a collection of [REDACTED] fictional manuscripts that [REDACTED] has created over the years. The manuscripts may contain some of the most disturbing content that have ever been written, and many who read the content experiance anguish. Unfortunately, most would need trauma therapy if they haven't already gouged out their own eyeballs. This phenomenon is known as the "Minion Cookie" curse.</br></br>
        It is thought that the manuscripts were created before the formation of Lez Pez table. Due to patterns within the manuscripts, some historians specalate that a portion of the manuscripts were torched and burned due to the disturbing nature of said manuscripts. The manuscripts are believed to be written based on sexual fantasies as a result of [REDACTED]'s black tar heroin induced psychosis during his time in the [REDACTED].</br></br>
        Thank you to [REDACTED] for the donation of the manuscripts.</br></br>
